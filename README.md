### # About
I started when I was 17, I'm a certified Python Django Developer (Meta) from Pakistan with over 3 Years+ of Programming and 5 Years of IT tech experience. I've worked on 6+ major projects, handling both frontend and backend development using Django Rest Framework and Django core. I have been making constant efforts to make a mark in the field of Computer Science, a thirst for knowledge and a productive approach to practicality, I am yearning to unleash my utmost potential. I have always been inspired by people who started almost from nothing and made a name for themselves. I aspire to become one of them. I see myself as capable of heading my own career and bring it to such a level that it would impact other people and change their lives.
